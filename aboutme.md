### My story

I'm from South Korea, and my family moved to the US in 2016 when I was 13 years old. 

I gained interest in computer engineering throughout my school years. Since my father works as a software engineer by profession, I had a lot of opportunities to get used to software working environment and various coding languages. After learning java and python by myself and taking CS course at high school, I determined my future career as a software engineer.

### Favorite Music

I like both Korean and American songs...

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
